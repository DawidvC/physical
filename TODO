1.  Add a 'print with prefix' setting for Quantity types.  This is so that
    items such as '10*kg' get printed as '10*physical::unit::kg'.  Do this so
    that subsequent parsing will succeed even if the user has not done
    'from physical::unit import *'.
    This change would be relevant for both the c++ and python versions.

2.  I'd like to come up with a cleaner way to separate the runtime and
    non-runtime portions of the library so that a more appropriate "#include"
    interface can be presented to the user.
