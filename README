Much of the data for the units and constants listed in this header are
freely available on usenet servers.  The reference for the original
header is comp.lang.cpp/2004-10/2217 by E. Robert Tisdale (10/17/04).
The namespace layout is original to the posting by E. Robert Tisdale.

There were a lot of other comments on usenet for improving the header from
Tisdale, including British spelling of various units and so on.  This library
is based on the unaltered version from E. R. Tisdale.


Since importing the file from E. R. Tisdale, I've extended this library heavily.
Various new units and constants have been added.  Most constants have been
checked and corrected according to CODATA from NIST:
