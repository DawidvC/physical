Installation Instructions
*************************

Because of the change to the Boost.build system, I still need to implement
installation of some sort.  If you use Boost.build, using the c++ portion is
easy.  CMake files also accompany the package and make it easier to use in a
CMake environment.  

For the python implementation, just make sure that the python directory is
added to your PYTHONPATH (however you choose do this).
As an example, for bash,  you could add the following line to your
.bash_profile file:
export PYTHONPATH=":/PATH/TO/PHYSICAL-PACKAGE/python:"


The gnuplot 'port' is not the most elegant (i.e. the namespaces are just
tacked onto the names, such as 'arc_centesimal_minute' instead of
'arc::centesimal::minute' but it has been handy for me.


For the octave/matlab version, you only have to run the 'physical.m' script
to get all of the units/contants loaded into memory as variables.  The
namespaces are loaded as structs, except that the physical::unit(s) and
physical::constant(s) prefixes are removed (perhaps this should not be the
case, but oh well).
